#### DATA STRUCTURES

>A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed struct or struct member, global or static variable, typedef, or enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

```c
/* In src/threads/thread.h, added to struct thread: */
int64_t wait_ticks; /**< Stores the absolute tick value when a sleeping thread should be woken up. Used by timer_sleep. */

/* In src/devices/timer.c: */
static struct list sleep_list; /**< List containing threads that are currently sleeping via timer_sleep(), ordered by wake-up time. */

static struct lock sleep_list_lock; /**< Mutex protecting sleep_list from concurrent access during insertions by multiple threads calling timer_sleep(). */

/* Note: Comparison functions (compare_tick_priority, compare_priority_greater) are helpers, not data structures. */
/* Note: wakeup_list in timer_interrupt is a local variable, not global/static. */
```

#### ALGORITHMS

>A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

1.  `timer_sleep(ticks)` calculates the absolute wake-up time (`wakeup_at`) and stores it in the current thread's `wait_ticks` field.
2.  It acquires the `sleep_list_lock` mutex.
3.  It inserts the current thread into the global `sleep_list`, ordered primarily by `wait_ticks` (ascending) and secondarily by priority (descending) using `compare_tick_priority`.
4.  It releases `sleep_list_lock`.
5.  It disables interrupts (`intr_disable`).
6.  It calls `thread_block()`, changing the thread's state to `BLOCKED` and yielding the CPU. Interrupts remain disabled at this point.
7.  When the thread is later unblocked by the interrupt handler and rescheduled, `thread_block()` returns, and `timer_sleep()` restores the original interrupt level via `intr_set_level(old_level)` before returning.
8.  The `timer_interrupt` handler, upon each tick:
    *   Increments the global `ticks` counter.
    *   Checks if `sleep_list` is empty; returns if so.
    *   Disables interrupts.
    *   Iterates through `sleep_list`. For threads whose `wait_ticks <= ticks`, it removes them from `sleep_list` and adds them to a temporary local `wakeup_list`, ordered by priority (descending) using `compare_priority_greater`. The iteration stops early because `sleep_list` is sorted by wake-up time.
    *   It then iterates through the priority-sorted `wakeup_list`, calling `thread_unblock(t)` for each thread `t`. `thread_unblock` changes the thread's state to `READY` and adds it to the scheduler's ready queue.
    *   Finally, the interrupt handler restores the previous interrupt level.

>A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>the timer interrupt handler?

1.  **Early Exit:** If `sleep_list` is empty, the handler returns immediately after incrementing `ticks`.
2.  **Sorted List Traversal:** The `sleep_list` is kept sorted by wake-up time (`wait_ticks`). The handler iterates through it and stops (`break`) as soon as it finds a thread whose wake-up time has not yet arrived, avoiding a full list scan.
3.  **Efficient Unblocking:** Threads ready to wake are moved to a temporary list, which is then processed. `thread_unblock` itself is intended to be efficient.

#### SYNCHRONIZATION

>A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>timer_sleep() simultaneously?

The `sleep_list_lock` mutex ensures mutual exclusion. Each thread calling `timer_sleep()` must acquire this lock before inserting its element into the shared `sleep_list`. Only one thread can hold the lock at a time, preventing concurrent modifications to the list structure by different threads.

>A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>during a call to timer_sleep()?

The `timer_interrupt` handler disables interrupts (`intr_disable()`) before accessing the `sleep_list`. This prevents the interrupt handler from running concurrently with the critical section in `timer_sleep()` that modifies the list (even if that section is protected by `sleep_list_lock`). If an interrupt occurs while a thread holds `sleep_list_lock`, the handler will run (disabling further interrupts), perform its atomic operations on `sleep_list`, re-enable interrupts, and then the interrupted thread can resume holding the lock. The lock prevents other *threads* from interfering, while interrupt disabling prevents the *handler* from interfering.

#### RATIONALE

>A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>another design you considered?

This design avoids the busy-waiting of the original implementation, significantly improving CPU efficiency. It uses a lock (`sleep_list_lock`) for thread-to-thread synchronization when adding to the sleep list and interrupt disabling within the `timer_interrupt` handler for atomicity and protection against thread/handler races.

It is superior to:

1.  **Busy-Waiting:** Blocking threads via `thread_block()` allows other useful work to be done, unlike the CPU-consuming loop in the original code.
2.  **Semaphore-Based Approach:** Eliminating per-thread semaphores reduces memory overhead and avoids the FIFO wake-up behavior of base Pintos `sema_up`, allowing wake-up order to be determined by priority using `thread_unblock` after sorting.
3.  **Separate Sleep Structs:** Storing `wait_ticks` directly in `struct thread` and using the thread's existing list element avoids allocating/freeing separate `sleep_entry` structs, reducing memory management overhead.
4.  **Pure Interrupt Disabling:** Using only interrupt disabling in `timer_sleep` (as considered previously) would disable *all* interrupts for longer durations, potentially harming system responsiveness. Using a lock limits the scope of disabled interrupts primarily to the interrupt handler itself.
5.  **Single Sorted Sleep List:** Keeping `sleep_list` sorted by wake-up time enables efficient identification of threads to wake in the interrupt handler.
6.  **Priority-Ordered Wake-up:** Using a temporary, priority-sorted `wakeup_list` ensures `thread_unblock` is called in the correct order for priority scheduling tests.
