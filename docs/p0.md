## Debugging

#### QUESTIONS: BIOS 

>B1: What is the first instruction that gets executed?

The first instruction that gets executed is:
```asm
ljmp   $0x3630,$0xf000e05b
```

>B2: At which physical address is this instruction located?

The physical address of this instruction is `0xffff0`.


#### QUESTIONS: BOOTLOADER

>B3: How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?

The `read_sector` function:
```asm
read_sector:
    pusha
    ...
    mov   $0x42, %ah       # AH=0x42 → "Extended Read Sectors" (LBA)
    mov   %sp, %si         # DS:SI → pointer to a 16‑byte Disk Address Packet
    int   $0x13            # BIOS Disk Service
    ...
    ret
```
It uses BIOS interrupt `0x13` with function `0x42` to pull sectors off the disk in real mode.

`int $0x13`: This is the software interrupt instruction that calls the BIOS Disk Service routine. The BIOS reads the function code from AH (which is `0x42`), finds the DAP using DS:SI, performs the requested sector read from the drive specified in DL (which was set by the caller), and writes the 512 bytes of data to the memory location ES:0000. The BIOS sets the Carry Flag (CF) if an error occurs and clears it on success.

>B4: How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?

It first checks if the partition is unused (`cmpl $0, %es:(%si)`). If so (`je next_partition`), it skips to the next entry.

**Check Type**: It then checks if the partition type byte (at offset 4 in the entry) is `0x20` (`cmpb $0x20, %es:4(%si)`). This is the type designated for Pintos kernel partitions. If it's not type `0x20` (`jne next_partition`), it skips to the next entry.

**Check Bootable Flag**: Finally, it checks if the status byte (at offset 0) is `0x80` (`cmpb $0x80, %es:(%si)`), indicating the partition is bootable.

>B5: What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?

If the bootloader iterates through all the hard drives and their partitions and fails to find a partition that is both bootable (status `0x80`) and has the Pintos kernel type (`0x20`), it follows these steps:

**Jump to Failure Label**: The control flow eventually reaches the `no_such_drive:` / `no_boot_partition:` section of the code.

**Print Error Message**: It calls the `puts` subroutine with the string `"Not found"`

**Invoke BIOS Boot Failure**: It executes the instruction `int $0x18`. This is a BIOS interrupt specifically designated to signal a boot failure. What happens exactly after this interrupt depends on the specific BIOS implementation, but it typically results in:
* Displaying a system message like "No bootable device found" or "Operating system not found"
* Halting the system, requiring a reboot or power cycle
* On very old systems, it might have dropped into ROM BASIC
Essentially, the bootloader gives up, prints "Not found", and tells the BIOS that the boot attempt failed, effectively stopping the boot process.

>B6: At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?

Based on the code in `src/threads/loader.S`:

**When**: The transfer happens immediately after the kernel loading loop finishes. Specifically, after the `loop next_sector` instruction has executed enough times to load the determined number of sectors, and after the final `call puts` with `"` (carriage return) is executed.

**How**: The transfer is achieved using an indirect far jump (`ljmp`) after constructing the target address:
* **Target Segment**: The kernel was loaded starting at physical address `0x20000`, which corresponds to segment `0x2000` in real mode.
* **Set ES Register**: `mov $0x2000, %ax` and `mov %ax, %es` set the `ES` register to `0x2000` to access the loaded kernel's data.
* **Read Entry Point Offset**: `mov %es:0x18, %dx` reads the 16-bit offset of the kernel's entry point from the ELF header (located at offset `0x18` within the loaded kernel image) into the `DX` register.
* **Store Far Pointer**:
  * `mov %dx, start`: The 16-bit offset is stored at the memory location labeled `start`.
  * `movw $0x2000, start + 2`: The 16-bit segment (`0x2000`) is stored immediately after the offset, at `start + 2`. These two instructions create a 4-byte `segment:offset` pointer in memory at the label `start`. (As the comments note, the memory at `start` cleverly reuses 4 bytes originally designated for the `read_failed` code path).
* **Execute Far Jump**: `ljmp *start` performs an indirect far jump. It reads the 4-byte pointer from the memory location `start`, loads the segment part (`0x2000`) into the `CS` register and the offset part (from the ELF header) into the `IP` register. This causes the processor to immediately begin executing code at the kernel's entry point (the `start` function in `src/threads/start.S`).
